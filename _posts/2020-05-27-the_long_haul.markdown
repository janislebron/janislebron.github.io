As a former English teacher, about 100 metaphors come to mind when I think about coding. But as it most relates to me now, as a noob with a lot of learning still ahead, the metaphor at the forefront of my mind is a long run.  

I have always loved sports. Always been a tomboy, always have preferred to run around in the sun, always looking to stay active. Naturally, this breeds a semi-healthy, semi-obsessive love and need for competition. I'd played softball and volleyball in high school, recreationally in college, and lately just with my friends at the park. Like most people, I love winning. And like most athletes, I'd much prefer winning a close game, where my effort is truly exerted, than take a W that came easily or games where I haven't played my best. My biggest competition has always been myself. 

Recently, I've taken up running. For anyone who knows who Bartolo Colon is -- one of my all time favorites -- you don't exactly need to be in shape to be a good softball player. Obviously it helps, and of course your coach will make you run, but it just doesn't demand the stamina that other sports do. I like to workout, I frequent yoga classes and boxing classes (I'm a complex individual), and love tossing a ball around. But running requires something else from you. My first run I the bar high. Thought that three miles was something I could do easily. But alas, after running for 45 minutes, I looked at my NRC app to see that I'd only been running for 18. Needless to say, the run was shorter than planned. Then, the first time I'd hit my three miles, I was disappointed in my time. I was a full two minutes over what I thought I was doing. I was annoyed that I wasn't already making the strides I'd worked to meet. And I'd then realized how so incredibly naive it was of me to assume that all the skills/training I'd accrued from things that were *like* running, would easily translate over to a completely different sport. It was kind of disrespectful to real runners who do tough things like run 26 miles in the rain just because they can. My transition into coding has been similar in that way. 

Just like my peers at the Flatiron School, I am constantly fighting to be the best version of myself. I try to be patient and kind when self-reflecting, but I don't like making the same mistake twice. But...coding is all about making mistakes. I know the point is not to fail but to learn from the failures, but it goes against the nature of my being. I've always been a good student, and I worked really hard to be a good teacher, and like running, expected that these loosely similar skills (common sense and work ethic) would translate and I'd only need to see things once to fully grasp. About 20% of my way in the program, I have acknowledged how arrogant it is of me to think that learning something new wouldn't or shouldn't be a challenge. There are meant to be challenges in anything new. And embracing the challenges is what makes the journey so much more fun. The best part of the run is not exactly when it's over, but the feeling I get when I reach a new milestone, or when I realize that this run is way easier than the one I took a month ago. Because even after I graduate, become a developer working with people I enjoy collaborating with, there will be new developments and versions and updates and languages I'll need to learn. And I love it. There's no room to get bored. Running into the problem isn't the part I'm supposed to relish, but instead the feeling I get when I remember all of the commas in my code for the first time.
