While preparing for this project, there were a lot of things I was concerned about. How complex it would be, debugging without the tests that the curriculum provides, leaving out layers/components and not realizing it -- the list goes on. I'd felt confident in my learning, but also aware of how complex programming can be. Conceptually, I feel like I have a strong understanding of the material (I have gotten this far, haven't I?), but I am definitely a student who can review the same material 10 times and still feel like there is more to know. Imposter syndrome had been gone awhile, and made its swift return right before I began my Kanye project. 

I'd watched a couple hours of other people programming their code from beginning to end. I enjoyed watching the skeleton/outline develop, but there was one major step that the taped lecture cut out: where do I run my program??? I'd always used Learn IDE to run my tests, and had familiarized myself with "pushing" things to GitHub, but I'd never even heard of VS Code until this past weekend. I'd spent days trying to figure out how to run my code, scouring Stack for answers. I was frustrated, because what I believed to be the easiest part of the assignment, was giving me the most trouble. But I was once again reminded of the important process of researching, and of the sweet, sweet feeling when you get what you are looking for. 

In retrospect, I am happy that I couldn't use AAQ for this final project because it caused me to problem solve on a level I didn't think I was capable of before. I have learned about building something from scratch, and though my gem is simple, my understanding and appreciation for that creation is great.
